# IMS IIIT Hyd Android Mobile Application

 This app originated as a project for the Design and Analysis of
Software Systems (DASS) course in the Spring 2024 semester, guided
by Prof. Raghu Reddy. It is currently an Android mobile application,
with an iOS version coming soon, dedicated to the IMS website of
IIIT Hyderabad.

Students can use the application to submit leave requests, add bank
accounts, and view their attendance, transcripts, and profile
details, including general information and address. They can also
check the status of their leave requests and bank applications.
Additionally, students can add or edit their bank details until they
receive approval.
