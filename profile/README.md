# My IIIT (H) Android Mobile Application

This app originated as a project for the Design and Analysis of Software Systems (DASS) course in the Spring 2024 semester, guided by Prof. Raghu Reddy. \
It is currently developed as an Android mobile application, with an iOS version coming soon, dedicated to the IMS (Institute Management System) of IIIT Hyderabad.

Students can use the application to submit leave requests and view their attendance, transcripts, and profile details, including general information and address. They can also check the status of their leave requests and bank applications. \
Faculty and Staff members can view their profile details. This app also features a very new feature - _IIIT Soochika_ - first digital version of the contact directory shared by the Institute with faculty and staff.

More features are planned for the upcoming versions.
